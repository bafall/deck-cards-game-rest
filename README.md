# Basic Deck of Cards Game


in JAVA a set of classes and a REST API that represent a deck of poker-style playing cards along with the services for a very basic game between multiple players holding cards. A deck is defined as follows:  Fifty-two playing cards in four suits: hearts, spades, clubs, and diamonds, with face values of Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, and King.
